# # LLMCompiler
#
# This notebook shows how to implement [LLMCompiler, by Kim, et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04511) in LangGraph.
#
# LLMCompiler is an agent architecture designed to **speed up** the execution of agentic tasks by eagerly-executed tasks within a DAG. It also saves costs on redundant token usage by reducing the number of calls to the LLM. Below is an overview of its computational graph:
#
# ![LLMCompiler Graph](./img/llm-compiler.png)
#
# It has 3 main components:
#
# 1. Planner: stream a DAG of tasks.
# 2. Task Fetching Unit: schedules and executes the tasks as soon as they are executable
# 3. Joiner: Responds to the user or triggers a second plan
#
#
# This notebook walks through each component and shows how to wire them together using LangGraph. The end result will leave a trace [like the following](https://smith.langchain.com/public/218c2677-c719-4147-b0e9-7bc3b5bb2623/r).
#
#
# **First,** install the dependencies, and set up LangSmith for tracing to more easily debug and observe the agent.

#         "problem": "What's the temp of Denver + 5?",
#         "context": ["The temperature of Denver is 32 degrees"],
#     }
# )

# # Part 2: Planner
#
#
# Largely adapted from [the original source code](https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/LLMCompiler/blob/main/src/llm_compiler/output_parser.py), the planner  accepts the input question and generates a task list to execute.
#
# If it is provided with a previous plan, it is instructed to re-plan, which is useful if, upon completion of the first batch of tasks, the agent must take more actions.
#
# The code below composes constructs the prompt template for the planner and composes it with LLM and output parser, defined in [output_parser.py](./output_parser.py). The output parser processes a task list in the following form:
#
# ```plaintext
# 1. tool_1(arg1="arg1", arg2=3.5, ...)
# Thought: I then want to find out Y by using tool_2
# 2. tool_2(arg1="", arg2="${1}")'
# 3. join()<END_OF_PLAN>"
# ```
#
# The "Thought" lines are optional. The `${#}` placeholders are variables. These are used to route tool (task) outputs to other tools.

# ## Conclusion
#
# Congrats on building your first LLMCompiler agent!
# I'll leave you with some known limitations to the implementation above:
#
"""
# 1. The planner output parsing format is fragile if your function requires more than 1 or 2 arguments. 
    # We could make it more robust by using streaming tool calling.
# 2. Variable substitution is fragile in the example above. 
    # It could be made more robust by using a fine-tuned model 
    # and a more robust syntax (using e.g., Lark or a tool calling schema)
# 3. The state can grow quite long if you require multiple re-planning runs. 
    # To handle, you could add a message compressor once you go above a certain token limit.
